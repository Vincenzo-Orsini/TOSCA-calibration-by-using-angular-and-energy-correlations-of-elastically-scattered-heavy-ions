The web-app is basede on the Plotly Dash Frameowrk
In order to assure the correct functioning of the code, downloading the libraries required is highly recommended if not mandatory.
```python
pip install -r 'requirements.txt'
```
If the user (as we suggest) intends to operate the app on a virtual environment, the installation is performed as mentioned 
```python
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r 'requirements.txt'
```
The application is then simply booted by the main.py script
```python
python3 main.py
```
